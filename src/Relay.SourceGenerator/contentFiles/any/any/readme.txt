Relay Source Generator

This package contains the Roslyn source generator for the Relay mediator framework.
The source generator automatically creates handler registrations, dispatch code, and
DI configurations at compile time to eliminate runtime reflection overhead.

No manual setup is required - the source generator will automatically run during
compilation when this package is referenced.
